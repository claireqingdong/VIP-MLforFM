# Spring 2023 VIP - Machine Learning for Financial Market
## Qing Claire Dong's Notebook

### Week 4, Feb 3
In class, we were forming teams. I decided my research interest would be on analyzing external factors of the stock market.  
Team meeting time: Friday 5 pm.

### Week 3, Jan 27
1/22 Research proposal completed

I was always trying to think about what factors determine one's gains and losses from the financial market, which is also to say, which factors act on stock prices and buy/sell actions. In an overly idealized situation, I wish to uncover a formula, which is a linear or non-linear combination of multiple factors, and that formula tells us if we should buy/sell a stock. Therefore I am interested in selecting factors/trading strategies as my broad research topic.

As I researched potentially useful financial metrics, I noticed Research and Development (R&D) Expenditure (Note: I was also interested in risk levels, but as SEC does not require risk factors to be in XBRL form, this restrain us from getting sufficient data.). Some articles present that high expenditure not necessarily indicates good performance, while some research demonstrated the high rate of return to invest in R&D. Some also indicate that it depends on sectors. If worth delving deeper into, my research question would be: Do companies' R&D Expenditures have correlations with stock prices, either in the short or long term?

There are two kinds of data sources I need, which would be price and company R&D data. For price data, I could use Yahoo finance to access daily close prices. For the latter one, I would use XBRL US to extract information on 10-K forms. Possible variables would be R&D cost amount, time, and sector.

One of the tools I would use would be machine learning, outputting future prices according to input variables. I would also like to learn about how to apply statistics in finance and be able to test whether a factor is significant for stock prices. Also, I am willing to know more about the existing research on finance and ML and be able to build upon those research.

### Week 1, Jan 13  
1/15 CITI RCR training completed  
1/16 Video: XBRL in Academic Research  
Link to the recording: https://www.fasb.org/academics#section-5  
Link to slides: https://www.fasb.org/document/blob?fileName=XBRL__Academic_Research-A_Workshop_on_How_to_Pull_XBRL_Data.pdf  
- XBRL: eXtensible Business Reporting Language
    - financial information that is machine-readable
    -  Each number has a link, so a machine can read it
    - Each link has information of tag, time, numberâ€¦
- Key features: 
    - Label used in filling(name on the chart) is not the element name. Element name = the long tag
    - Elements can be standard across firm or custom defined by the firm(extension)
    - Presentation metadata
- Get tagged: Number , table, accounting policies
- institutions: XBRL international, XBRL US help implement, FASB published, SEC oversight
- How can XBRL help
    - More details inside tags
    - Comparison made easy
    - As-reported(no selective reporting), presentation, text
- Research about XBRL
    - Data quality, regulation, disclosure choices, firm characteristic
- Challenges with using XBRL in research
    - Identifying relevant XBRL elements
    - ? Standardizing compression across firm
    - Errors like duplication, incorrect scale, sign
- How can I access XBRL data?  
  
Hands-on Exercises: Gather data on Revenue 
1. Identify common US GAAP revenue elements 
- Yeti: details of all US GAAP elements - http://xbrlview.fasb.org/yeti/resources/yeti-gwt/Yeti.jsp
    - Browse and get the Name
- EDGAR
    - Company name, filing type, interactive data(or documents), select chart, name, details  
2. Download facts for US GAAP revenue elements - see slides for instruction
- With instruction of python and postgresql, calcbench
- Difference and tradeoffs of standardized data and raw data
3. Search for dimensional data and custom extensions
- Culcbench demonstration, and in python and in postgresql
- Company might use one year standard, one year custom
4. Cleaning data, dimensional data, footnote text search and analysis, metadata

Thought Questions: 1. How to get the data: free resources  - XBRL US and SEC for filing data, Yahoo and S&P for price data  
2. What questions interest me: risk management, statistical testing?

To-do:
1. Coding task and proposal due 1/26 
2. Know how to use XBRL API & SEC
