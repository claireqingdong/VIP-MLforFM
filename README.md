- XBRL: eXtensible Business Reporting Language
    - financial information that is machine-readable
    -  Each number has a link, so a machine can read it
    - Each link has information of tag, time, numberâ€¦
- Key features: 
    - Label used in filling(name on the chart) is not the element name. Element name = the long tag
    - Elements can be standard across firm or custom defined by the firm(extension)
    - Presentation metadata
- Get tagged: Number , table, accounting policies
- institutions: XBRL international, XBRL US help implement, FASB published, SEC oversight
- How can XBRL help
    - More details inside tags
    - Comparison made easy
    - As-reported(no selective reporting), presentation, text
- Research about XBRL
    - Data quality, regulation, disclosure choices, firm characteristic
- Challenges with using XBRL in research
    - Identifying relevant XBRL elements
    - ? Standardizing compression across firm
    - Errors like duplication, incorrect scale, sign
- How can I access XBRL data?  
  
Hands-on Exercises: Gather data on Revenue 
1. Identify common US GAAP revenue elements 
- Yeti: details of all US GAAP elements - http://xbrlview.fasb.org/yeti/resources/yeti-gwt/Yeti.jsp
    - Browse and get the Name
- EDGAR
    - Company name, filing type, interactive data(or documents), select chart, name, details  
2. Download facts for US GAAP revenue elements - see slides for instruction
- With instruction of python and postgresql, calcbench
- Difference and tradeoffs of standardized data and raw data
3. Search for dimensional data and custom extensions
- Culcbench demonstration, and in python and in postgresql
- Company might use one year standard, one year custom
4. Cleaning data, dimensional data, footnote text search and analysis, metadata

Thought Questions: 1. How to get the data: free resources  - XBRL US and SEC for filing data, Yahoo and S&P for price data  
2. What questions interest me: risk management, statistical testing?

To-do:
1. Coding task and proposal due 1/26 
2. Know how to use XBRL API & SEC
